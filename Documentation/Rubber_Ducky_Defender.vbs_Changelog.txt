v1.1 - Switch from Devcon to shutdown.

-v1.1.
-Devcon isn't going to work.
-Add possibility to confirm attached device is or is not a keyboard.
-Improve performance.
-Switch from trying to detect individual devices and disabling them with Devcon to either simple logging/notifications or shutting down the entire machine.
-Devcon won't work because some HID Keyboard Device drivers are not "disable-able" in the first place, there are too many different versions of DevCon, the documentation is poor, and the licensing is vague and ambigious.
-Add documentation.
-There are still going to be bugs. Loops could be cleaned up more and the timing needs to be perfected to avoid multiple detections.
